Boolean Search(String arg): This function should return true if given argument is in your trie, 
otherwise it should return false. 

Void autoComplete(String prefix): This function should print all strings start with given prefix in 
your trie, lexicographically. 

Void reverseAutoComplete(String suffix): This function should print all strings end with given 
suffix in your trie, lexicographically. For this function, you may consider using multi-trie solution, or 
research and use more complex data structures such as suffix arrays.
 
Void FullAutoComplete(String prefix, String suffix): This function should print all strings start with 
given prefix and end with given suffix in your trie, lexicographically. For this function, you may 
consider using multi-trie solution, or research and use more complex data structures such as suffix 
arrays. 

Void findTopK(int k): This function should print top k words that have most occurrences, 
lexicographically. For this function, you may use a symbol table that keeps track of the number of 
appearances of each key.
